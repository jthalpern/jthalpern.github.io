Welcome to my site! 

I’m Jordan Halpern, a communications specialist with 7 years’ experience. 

Since 2018, I've worked in the field of digital publishing, where I have written, edited, and published over a million words in the Amazon Kindle store under various pen names. I've worn every hat imaginable in the publication process, including research, writing, editing, formatting, graphic design, and marketing. 
Now I'm pursuing a transition away from self-employment, and I believe my set of skills can offer a unique value to employers.

Feel free to check out my [**portfolio**](/portfolio/) or go [**here**](/about/) to learn a little more about me. 

Thanks for stopping by!
