Welcome to my site! 

I’m Jordan Halpern, a writer, editor, and content designer with over 6 years’ experience publishing on Amazon. Since 2018, I've worked full-time in the field of digital publishing, where I have written, edited, and published over a million words in the Kindle store under various pen names. I've worn every hat imaginable in the publication process, including research, writing, editing, formatting, graphic design, and marketing. 
Now I'm pursuing a career transition towards technical writing, and I believe my set of skills can offer unique value to employers.

You can check out my [**portfolio**](/portfolio/), read my [**resume**](/resume/), or go [**here**](/about/) to learn a little more about me. 

Thanks for stopping by!
