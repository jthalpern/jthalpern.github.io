In this portfolio, I am showcasing graphic design work that I've created for the Luna Voss romance author brand.

## Typography and photo bashing

Here are four book covers I designed, including layouts and typography. The first three were created from stock photos, and the fourth from a mixture of stock photos and custom AI assets.

All four novels reached the top 1,000 of the US Kindle store, with two of them reaching the top 500. 

## Print

Here is my design for a paperback, compared to the printed version:

## Advertisments 

This is an ad I created for BookBub, a pay-per-click advertising platform common in the publishing  world. It achieved an impressive click-through rate of nearly 5% at a time when 2-3% was considered very good. This high CTR allowed the ad to garner thousands of clicks at the unusually cheap price of only $0.24 per click.

## Web assets

Amazon allows what is called "A+" content on product pages. Here are some that I've designed:
