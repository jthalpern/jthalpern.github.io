I am presenting here graphic design work that I've done for the Luna Voss romance author brand. Here are four book covers that I designed, including layouts and typography. The first three were created from stock photos, and the fourth from a mixture of stock photos and custom AI assets.

All four novels reached the top 1,000 of the US Kindle store, with two of them reaching the top 500. 

Here is my design for a paperback, compared to the printed version:

Amazon allows what is called "A+" content on product pages. Here are some that I've designed:
