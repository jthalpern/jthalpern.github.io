Hi! My name is Jordan Halpern, and I live in northern California.

Since 2018, I have independently built and managed a successful digital publishing business, writing, editing, and publishing more than a dozen novels under various pen names—several of which have reached the top 500 bestsellers on Amazon. Beyond storytelling, I have driven my books' success through strategic marketing, including graphic design, copywriting, PPC advertising, and email campaigns. From concept to completion, I oversee every step of the publishing process, from designing the covers to formatting the finished manuscripts.

Moving forward in my career, I’m looking to transition from self-employment into a full-time role where my expertise and strong work ethic can contribute to an organization's success.


**Things I love:** 
* movies 
* spending time outdoors
* pizza

**Fun facts:**
* I'm a big history nerd
* I directed short films in high school and college
* I just created my first terrarium
* I once got caught in a thunderstorm on the rim of the Grand canyon. It quickly escalated from a pretty sunset to pouring rain and lightning all around us. Scary at the time, but a great memory
