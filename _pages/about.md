Hi! My name is Jordan Halpern, and I live in northern California.

My interest in technical writing started before I even had a name for it, when I was asked to document operating and troubleshooting a mechanical button machine at an old job. I've been writing professionally for the last 6 years as an independent author, and now I'm excited to be transitioning into technical writing. As a communicator, there is nothing more satisfying to me than figuring out how to express a complicated idea simply and effectively.

**Things I love:** learning, the outdoors, pizza

**Fun facts:**
* I'm a big history nerd
* I directed short films in high school and college
* I once got caught in a thunderstorm on the rim of the Grand canyon. Went quickly from a pretty sunset to pouring rain and lightning all around us. Scary at the time, but a 10/10 memory.
