#### I have experience running a business, and I know that my work fits into a bigger picture 
I'm not just a writer. I bring over 6 years' experience helming a successful publishing business, performing every role from accounting, to copywriting, to conducting market research and creating customer avatars. I understand the bigger picture, and the importance of aligning my work with organizational goals.


#### I know how to manage projects, juggle multiple priorities, and meet deadlines 
The world of digital publishing is extremely fast-paced. My first book (37K words) went from concept to publication in under a month. I am very experienced managing multiple, complex projects, and doing it all on time.


#### I'm a fast and self-directed learner, very capable of quickly picking up new skills, software, style guides, etc. 
I taught myself how to build this website. My ability to quickly learn new skills, tools, and concepts has been essential to my success in publishing. This adaptability means I can hit the ground running in just about any work or software environment.


#### I'm extremely capable of working independently, but I also know how to collaborate 
I'm used to being productive, prioritizing tasks, and completing projects in a self-directed way. That said, I also have experience collaborating with team members such as beta readers, audiobook narrators, and various other stakeholders.
