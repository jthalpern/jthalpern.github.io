# Scrivener Quick-Start Guide for Novelists (Windows)

Scrivener is a powerful software tool for writing a book. But with a host of complex features and a nearly 800-page user manual, using it for the first time can be intimidating. This guide is designed to get you started. It demonstrates:



* How to set up a new project
* Best practices for writing in Scrivener
* How to export your manuscript for compatibility with two popular book formatting programs, Vellum and Atticus


## Getting Started

When you open Scrivener for the first time, it will bring up the New Project window. Go to the “Fiction” tab on the left, select “Novel,” and click “Create.”

You will then be prompted to select a location on your computer to save your project. Pick somewhere you’ll remember, like a folder named “Scrivener projects.”

When your new project opens, you’ll see a vertical bar on the left side of the screen. This is called the binder. 


## The Binder

In a traditional word processor, your book would be composed of one big, long text document. This makes precise navigation difficult, particularly for projects with many chapters. In Scrivener, your work is instead broken up into many smaller documents, which you can further organize through a system of folders. You access these folders and documents through the binder. 

Let’s take a closer look:


![alt_text](\assets\images\Scriv tut\image3.png "image_tooltip")

_Folders are distinguishable from documents by their blue icons and **bolded **text._

At the top is the “Manuscript” item. This is the overarching folder that contains your entire book. As you can see, both “Manuscript” and “Chapter” have downwards arrows next to them. This indicates that they are folders with items inside them. The document “Scene” is contained within the “Chapter” folder, which is itself contained within “Manuscript.”

This hierarchy is the basic way you will organize your book, and it is highly customizable. The default setup suggests a folder for each chapter, with documents inside for each scene (or section if you’re writing nonfiction). To start a second chapter, you would simply create a second folder, which would contain its own documents.

However, the options are endless. If you had selected “Novel (with parts)” as your project template earlier, your “Chapter” folder would be contained within a “Part” folder. You can also avoid folders entirely, and simply have a document for each chapter inside of “Manuscript.” 

It’s all up to you, and you have total freedom to rearrange things as you please at any time.


![alt_text](\assets\images\Scriv tut\image4.png "image_tooltip")

_You can move items in the binder by dragging them with your mouse. To create a new folder or document, use the buttons at the bottom-left._

Take a moment to set things up in whatever structure you like best. Some examples are below:


|![](\assets\images\Scriv tut\image5a.png)|![](\assets\images\Scriv tut\image5b.png)|![](\assets\images\Scriv tut\image5c.png)|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|_Chapter folders w/ parts_|_Chapter folders_|_Chapter documents_|


For now, feel free to ignore the other items in the binder (Characters, Places, etc.) These are resources you can use, but they are not a part of your book, and can be deleted if desired. Only documents contained within the “Manuscript” folder are included in your finished work. 

(“Front Matter” can typically be deleted, as most authors will add this material during formatting.)


## Writing

Now you’re ready to write! You’ll notice that when you select a document in the binder, the main area of the screen turns into a blank, white page. To start typing, all you have to do is click the center of the screen. You can also press F11 to enter “composition mode,” which is a full-screen view of your document.


![alt_text](\assets\images\Scriv tut\image6.png "image_tooltip")


You can change the font settings, but it’s unnecessary. You’re producing a manuscript, not a finished product. All the fancy formatting will take place later, in a different program. At this stage, restrict your formatting to italicizing words and styling any headings as “Heading 2”.

The one thing you may need to consider is the matter of _scene breaks_. If your binder is structured so that a single document represents an entire chapter, each document/chapter might contain multiple scenes. These scenes must be separated by scene breaks. You can indicate a scene break by inserting three asterisks on their own line, like this:

***

If each chapter is a folder containing multiple scenes, don’t worry about this. Scene breaks will be inserted automatically upon export.

If your chapters will be titled, you can name each appropriate folder or document (whatever unit represents a chapter within your hierarchy) with its intended chapter title. Otherwise, you can call them anything you want. You can also have a setup where your chapter folders are titled, and your scenes are named descriptively, as shown below:


![alt_text](\assets\images\Scriv tut\image7.png "image_tooltip")

_In this example, “The House in the Valley” is the name of a chapter, and the scenes within it are labeled purely for the author’s benefit._

When you export your finished manuscript, you’ll be able to control whether the names you give your folders and documents will be included in the final product.


## Exporting

Finishing your project in Scrivener is a little more complicated than in a standard word processor. In Scrivener, you need to export using something called the compiler. The compiler takes all the separate pieces of your manuscript and turns them into a single, complete document.

Open the compiler by pressing Ctrl+Shift+E.


![alt_text](\assets\images\Scriv tut\image8.png "image_tooltip")


First, at the top of the screen, make sure “Compile For:” is set to “Microsoft Word (.docx).” Scrivener can compile in other formats, but this is what you will want for most purposes.


### Compile Options

The first thing to pay attention to is “compile options,” highlighted in blue on the right. Basically, this is where you tell Scrivener how you organized your binder, so it knows the difference between a part, a chapter, and a scene.

If every text document in your binder represents a separate chapter, designate each document as “Chapter.”

If your chapters are folders with multiple documents inside, designate each chapter folder as “Chapter Heading” and each document as “Scene.”

If you have folders dividing your book into parts, designate each part folder as “Part Heading.”


### Compile Formats

On the left of the compiler window, you are asked to select a format, which is basically a style guide that governs how your manuscript is compiled. If you will be using the software Vellum to format your manuscript, select “Vellum Export.” If you will be formatting in Atticus, select “Modern.” 


### Section Layouts

Scrolling through this section shows how each element (chapter, scene, etc.) in your manuscript will be formatted. Only the elements you designate under “Compile Options” will be displayed. 

Let’s take a look at the “Vellum Export” format. The default options are slightly different from “Modern,” but the principles are the same.


<img align="left" width="50%" src="\assets\images\Scriv tut\image9.png" alt="My Image" style="padding-right: 10px;">

<div style="font-size:14pt; "> <em> This layout for “Chapter Heading” will automatically number your chapters in the format shown, with the name of the corresponding binder item below it as the chapter title.
<br>
<br>
<br>
This layout for “Scene” will show only the text contained within the corresponding document, without a heading. </em></div>


<br>
<p> There’s a good chance you’ll be happy with the defaults, but you may want to make a change (for instance, if your chapters are not titled.) To do that, click “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the compiler window. </p>


<img align="left" width="50%" src="\assets\images\Scriv tut\image10.png" alt="My Image" style="padding-right: 10px;">

<br>
<br>
<div style="font-size:14pt; "> <em> Choosing the highlighted layout will create chapter headings that display only the chapter number, without a chapter title. </em></div>


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


### Final Step (Atticus only)

If you will be formatting your manuscript in Vellum, your work is already done. You can compile your manuscript and send the .docx file to the next stage. If, however, you will be formatting in Atticus, there is one more step you need to take.

Remember scene breaks? If you’re organizing your binder as shown in ***example A***, you’ve been inserting them manually in the form of three asterisks. In that case, you can skip this step.


<img align="left" width="50%" src="\assets\images\Scriv tut\image11a.png" alt="My Image" style="padding-right: 10px;">
<img align="right" width="50%" src="\assets\images\Scriv tut\image11b.png" alt="My Image">

<br>

But if your binder is organized like ***example B***, where a chapter-folder contains multiple document-scenes, you need the compiler to insert those three asterisks for you. This is necessary because when you import into Atticus, the program will rely on these scene breaks to parse your manuscript correctly.

To accomplish this, right-click on the “Modern” format in the compiler window and select “Duplicate & Edit Format.”


![alt_text](\assets\images\Scriv tut\image12.png "image_tooltip")


From the bar on the left, select “Separators,” then under Section Layouts, select “Section Text.” Finally, under “Separator between sections,” choose “Custom” from the dropdown menu and enter three asterisks for the custom text.

You are now ready to compile a.docx file that will import seamlessly into Atticus.
